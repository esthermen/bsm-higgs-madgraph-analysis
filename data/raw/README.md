# Raw Data

This folder contains representative MadGraph output files used for cross-section extraction.

The files are not the full event samples, but selected outputs that include:

- Process definition
- Model configuration
- Cross-section summary

These files are used by the analysis scripts in `scripts/analysis.py`.
