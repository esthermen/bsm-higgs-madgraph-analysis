# BSM Higgs Sector Simulation – MadGraph Analysis

Computational study of a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) extension of the Standard Model.

This repository presents a reproducible numerical analysis of scalar sector extensions, focusing on cross-section deviations between Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model configurations.

# Research Background

The project is based on my undergraduate thesis, where I investigated a scalar sector extension introducing a second Higgs doublet. The computational work involved:

- Implementing the model in MadGraph

- Generating production processes

- Extracting cross-sections

- Comparing heavy and light Higgs phenomenology

The analysis required both theoretical understanding of the scalar potential and numerical interpretation of simulation outputs.
